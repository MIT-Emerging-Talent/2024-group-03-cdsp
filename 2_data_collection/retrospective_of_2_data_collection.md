## Introduction
Date: 29 January - 2 February, 2024                                                                                                                              
This milestone focuses on the Data Collection phase of the project.


## Achievements
1. Depending on our problem set we started looking for different data sets that have our same domain. 

2. We worked on the data collection of the [Google Trends Data on ChatGPT Risks](Google_Trends_On_ChatGPT_Risks.md)

3. We worked on the data collection of the [Global_Trends_in_Mental_Health_Dataset_Description](Global_Trends_in_Mental_Health_Dataset_Discription.md)

4. We worked on the data collection of the [ChatGPT simulation on relevant questions](ChatGPT_simulation_data.md)

5. We worked on the data collection of the [Social media impact on mental health](Social_Media_impact_on_Mental_Health.md)                                                       


## Challenges Faced
Having the new team members and all of us getting used to one another and explaining the work flow.                                                              
Many people were supposed to merge with our group but not all where available so it took time adjusting to the team.                                             


## Team Dynamics and Collaboration
New team members joined our group and the work became distributed better.                                                                                        
We have two meetings per week, which through we discuss what needs to be done through out the milestone and the team divides the work between them.
