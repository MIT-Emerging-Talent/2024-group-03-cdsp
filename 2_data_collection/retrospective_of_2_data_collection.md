## Challenges Faced
Having the new team members and all of us getting used to one another and explaining the work flow.														
Many people were supposed to merge with our group but not all where available so it took time adjusting to the team.

## Team Dynamics and Collaboration
New team members joined our group and the work became distributed better.
We have two meetings per week, which through we discuss what needs to be done through out the milestone and the team divides the work between them.
