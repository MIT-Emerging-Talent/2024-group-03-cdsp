# Mental Health Support of ChatGPT vs Human Simulation

This research aims to explore the effectiveness of using ChatGPT for mental health support compared to human mental counselors. 
The analysis involves simulating ChatGPT responses to requests from individuals with mental health concerns and comparing them to responses from trained mental health professionals. 


## Dataset Used

The research utilizes the "Mental Health Counseling Conversations" dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/nlp-mental-health-conversations). This dataset contains a collection of conversations between individuals seeking mental health support and trained mental health professionals. Each entry in the dataset consists of a context, which is the request or query sentence from the individual seeking support, and multiple responses from mental health counselors. The responses provided by counselors aim to address the concerns raised in the context and provide appropriate support and guidance. The dataset structure includes columns for context and response, allowing for the comparison of ChatGPT-generated responses with those provided by human counselors. Additionally, the dataset undergoes preprocessing to ensure consistency and relevance for the research analysis.

| Column   | Description                                   |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Context  | Request or query sentence from the individual seeking mental health support |
| Response | Response provided by trained mental health professionals to address the concerns raised in the context |
  
This structure allows for the comparison of responses generated by ChatGPT with those provided by human counselors, enabling an evaluation of ChatGPT's effectiveness in providing mental health support.
During the research this dataset was explored and cleaned. It appears to be a good source for the simulation
