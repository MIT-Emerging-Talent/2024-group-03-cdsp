## What is the artifact?
We've launched our first meme page on Instagram that focuses on conveying the dangers of chatbots and social media in a humorous way:

## Justification
Since our [target audience](TargetAudience.md) can be found on social media platforms, we decided to reach them through it. Memes are an engaging format that allows us to communicate complex ideas in a humorous and relatable way. Memes also spread quickly making it easier to reach a bigger number of people. This approach not only entertains, but also open minds to new perspectives, making them more receptive to the underlying message.

## Future Plans
We plan to expand to other social media platforms such as Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube. Short videos are a great way to reach our audience and we plan to utilize them more.
