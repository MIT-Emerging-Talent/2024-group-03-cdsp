## Introduction
Date: 19 February - 11 March, 2024                                                                                                                            
This milestone focuses on the Communicating Results phase of the project.

## Achievements
1- We worked on fixing our repository's main structure.                                                                                                           
2- We worked on creating our Artifact                                                                                                                            
3- We worked on describing and identifying our target audience                                                                                                    
4- We worked on the script for our final presentation                                                                                                            
5- We worked on finalizing the ChatGPT-simulation analysis

## Challenges Faced
Coming up with the artifact was a big challenge that required a lot of brainstorming.                                                                            
We faced problems in finding a time where enough people in the team was available to meet.

## Team Dynamics and Collaboration
Some team members where not available, but still the work flow has been good and the rest of the team is participating perfectly.                                
We have two meetings per week, which through we discuss what needs to be done through out the milestone and the team divides the work between them.

## Conclusions
Thinking through the eyes of a data scientist in this stage caused us to be stuck for a long time. One of the major things that helped us was to put ourselves in the shoes of our audience and to speak as if we were speaking to our families. We had to take it less seriously and have more fun with it.
