 ## Achievements 
* Main achievements for this milestone was showcase of our project work to our peers and MIT team.
* We dedicated time and effort to prepare for the presentation, ensuring that all 
team members were aligned on the content and flow of the presentation.

## Challenges Faced
* We had difficulties managing our time during the presentation to ensure that each section 
received enough attention during 4 minutes.
* We thought that some technical details could be overly complex and simplified the presentation. 
Now we think about the best way to navigate between technical complexity and over simplifying.

## Team Dynamics and Collaboration
The team showed the highest level of organization in asynchronous work. During preparation time
we did not feel lack communication. We organized extra calls to work together for better result. 

## Conclusions

Recognizing the importance of open communication within the team, we learned that environment
where all team members feel comfortable expressing their ideas and concerns is crucial. We openly 
provided our ideas and then gathered all of them in our final presentation.
