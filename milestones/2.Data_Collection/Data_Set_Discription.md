The first dataset we'll be working with is the Kaggle Mental Health Data Set https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imtkaggleteam/mental-health?resource=download:

## About The Dataset
The dataset provided in the Kaggle link contains information on a range of topics related to mental health, such as depression, anxiety, stress levels, coping mechanisms, treatment methods, etc.
It doesn't specify the gender or the age of the participants in the dataset, while covering approximately 215 different countries through the years from 1990 - 2019.
Surveys and screening questionnaires can be used to collet the data being referenced. They tend to ask people about symptoms similar to those in diagnostic manuals,
but they can be used more easily and widely because the data does not need to be collected by a healthcare professional.

## Contents
The dataset consists of a CVS file, where the rows represents the different countries varing through out the years.
The columns contain 5 mental health disordes (Schizophrenia disorder, Depressive disorder, Anxiety disorder, Bipolar disorder, and Eating disorder)

## Strengths of Survey Data
As mentioned in the dataset..
First, it involves structured interviews – people are asked a consistent set of questions regardless of their interviewer.
This helps to ensure the data is more comparable between interviewers and across time.
Second, surveys include a much wider range of people in the population, including those who would not seek treatment due to a lack of awareness, costs, or other concerns.

## Potential Flaws
Without examining the dataset directly, it's challenging to identify specific flaws. However, common issues in datasets related to mental health might include biases in the sample population,
self-reporting biases, missing data, or inaccuracies in responses.
As mentioned in the dataset, people may not share their symptoms in surveys, as they may not feel comfortable sharing them with researchers.
Along with this, people’s comfort in sharing mental health symptoms may vary between countries and over time.
Another limitation is that people may not remember their symptoms, especially when they are asked to recall symptoms in their lifetime so far.
This can be challenging for older people whose symptoms may have occurred decades ago.
