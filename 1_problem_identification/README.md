<!--A problem-statement based on your personal experiences-->
## Problem Statement: 
Mental health care is crucial for overall well-being, as it encompasses emotional, 
psychological, and social aspects of a person's life. Just as physical health requires 
attention and treatment, so too does mental health. Neglecting mental health can lead 
to various issues such as anxiety, depression, and stress, impacting one's quality of 
life and ability to function effectively.

One significant aspect of mental health in the digital age is the rise of internet 
addiction. With the increasing prevalence of smartphones, social media platforms, and 
development of AI tools, individuals are becoming more susceptible to excessive internet
usage, leading to addiction. Digital addiction can disrupt sleep patterns, decrease 
productivity, strain relationships, and exacerbate existing mental health conditions.

## Key issues:

AI is the latest trend, we notice some people prefer chatting with AI instead of having
conversation with friends, family members, or real people.
The increasing preference for chatting with AI rather than real people presents a unique
psychological landscape with potential implications for mental health. While conversing
with AI can offer convenience, anonymity, and immediate responses, it also poses risks
for certain individuals.

One primary concern is the potential for social isolation and loneliness. Human
connections are essential for mental well-being, providing emotional support, validation,
and a sense of belonging. Choosing AI companionship over real human interaction may lead
to feelings of disconnection and alienation, ultimately exacerbating loneliness and
increasing the risk of mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety.

## Impact
While AI tools may offer benefits, they can also pose risks to mental health. 
Our team decided to investigate how reliance on AI for emotional support or guidance may
affect individuals' perceptions of their own mental well-being. Identifying potential
risks allows for the development of safeguards and guidelines to minimize harm.
