## System thinking

1. Understanding complexity of the system: Understanding that development of depression is a complex of factors and digital addiction can be only one of them, but not the main cause.
2. Understanding interconnections: Elements within a system are interconnected and interdependent. Changes in one part of the system can have ripple effects throughout the entire system. A lot of different factors such as availability of the information. availability of medicine and level of diagnostic in different countries can impact on our findings. Keep it in mind making conclusions.
3. Finding oops: Look for patterns where one thing affects another.
4. Boundaries: Define boundaries around the system of interest, distinguishing it from its environment. Understanding these boundaries helps clarify what is included within the system and what is external to it.
5. Dynamic Behavior: Systems are dynamic and evolve over time. Keep in mind understanding how systems change and adapt in response to internal and external influences.

## Design thinking

1. Empathize: From personal and close people experience we understand that Internet, social media and AI tools and give us not only benefits, but also some risks and their understanding helps us to decrease the harmful impact. 
2. Define the issue: We will explore the connections between growing of popularity of social media (10-5 years ago), AI chatbots (last two years) and level of depression in different countries.
3. Ideas how to explore: While we don't have open data connected with AI usage, we want to analyze global trends for the level of depression since 2000 when Internet tarted to gain the popularity and no social media existed, then how it changed in 2010-2015 with growing of popularity of Social media, and then the most fresh data. We will explore the connections between development of social media and AI and diagnosed depression. 
4. Iterate: We are going to continuously refine our solution based on the feedback, insights, and new discoveries.
