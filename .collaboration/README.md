# Algorithms and Data Structures: Group Study
## Group norms
Our group fosters a culture characterized by respect, open-mindedness, clear communication, and active participation as we work towards common objectives.

Mutual respect is at the core of our interactions, embracing differences in ideas and perspectives. We welcome change and actively seek shared ideas, prioritizing collaboration over individual preferences. Communication is transparent and consistent – we remain engaged and provide constructive feedback to one another.

Time is a valuable resource, and we demonstrate respect for each other's schedules. Punctuality is a shared commitment, and we adhere to agreed timelines, promptly reporting our progress and communicating any deviations from the plan. Our honesty extends to acknowledging both successes and failures.

Each team member is genuinely involved in the project, driven by personal commitment to our collective goals. We are proactive in our decision-making, ensuring alignment with both individual and shared objectives.

Constructive and positive feedback is actively encouraged. When providing feedback, we aim to be specific, timely, and focused on aiding each other's improvement. This approach ensures that our feedback is not only constructive but also contributes to the overall growth and success of the group.

Meeting agendas, summaries, and reminders If you can’t attend a meeting or a session by MIT, then let the team know ASAP, at least two days in advance if possible. At least 2 members attend the sessions by MIT
