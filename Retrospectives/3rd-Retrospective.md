## Introduction
Date: 5-16 February, 2024
This milestone focuses on the data analysis phase of the project.

## Acheivements
1- Explored the Global Trends in Mental Health dataset, adding the data of social media users percentage. Worked on finalizing notebook, wrote conclusions,
as what can be seen from plots and made a README.md with description of the work done.
2- Worked on the analysis on ChatGPT's rising public interest and its comparison with social media anxiety trends, indicating a shift in societal concerns towards AI.

## In Process
1- Doing an EDA for the Wellfare effect of social media dataset.                                                                                              
2- Working on the 50 Indian student dataset about the mental health literacy using ChatGPT.

## Challenges Faced
Finding the data necessary for our work was a bit difficult, since we couldn't find datasets related to our research questions.

## Tools and Technique Evaluation
We've tried working with some new tools and it's been good so far,
- Pandas
- Excel
- Jupyter Notebook
- google Trends

## Team Dynamics and Collaboration
We're facing some conflicts as not all the team is available, but still the work flow has been good and the rest of the team is participating perfectly.
We have two meetings per week, which through we discuss what needs to be done through out the milestone and the team divides the work between them.

## Conclusions
We think our overall work is good to some point and only a few things are missing, which we are working on fixing and completing.
We have learned a lot of new stuff through out this milestone phase.
