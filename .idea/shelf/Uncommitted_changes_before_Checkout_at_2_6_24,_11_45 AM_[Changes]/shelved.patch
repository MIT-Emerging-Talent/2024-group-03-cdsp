 ## Problem Statement: 
-AI is the latest trend, we see people spending more time chatting with AI than with friends, family, or real people.
+Mental health care is crucial for overall well-being, as it encompasses emotional, 
+psychological, and social aspects of a person's life. Just as physical health requires 
+attention and treatment, so too does mental health. Neglecting mental health can lead 
+to various issues such as anxiety, depression, and stress, impacting one's quality of 
+life and ability to function effectively.
+One significant aspect of mental health in the digital age is the rise of internet 
+addiction. With the increasing prevalence of smartphones, social media platforms, 
+and development of AI tools, individuals are becoming more susceptible to excessive 
+internet usage, leading to addiction. Digital addiction can disrupt sleep patterns, 
+decrease productivity, strain relationships, and exacerbate existing mental health 
+conditions.
+AI is the latest trend, we noticed some people spending more time chatting with AI 
+than with friends, family members, or real people.
