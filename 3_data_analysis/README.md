# Data Analysis 

Currently, open data on the influence of AI on mental health is unavailable. Therefore, we've chosen to investigate the influence of social media on mental health, assuming that these findings may highlight the potential effects of AI.
 
We explore several data sets. To read full information about datasets being used, please follow the links:

## Key findings

## Global trends in mental health
We explored the global trends in mental health dataset and its correlation to 
social media users. Mental health is influenced by many factors, but here some 
patterns can be seen. The rise of social media slightly decreases depression in 
many countries, as well as increases anxiety and some other disorders. These 
patterns confirm the importance of our research.

## Social media impact on mental health
We analyzed the dataset “Social Media and Mental Health”. The correlation 
coefficient  between the amount of time online and the impact on mental health is
positive, but it's relatively weak. Symptoms for each condition increase with 
increasing time spent on social media. Controlling your time online and dedicating 
time for real life should minimize these negative impacts.

## Google trends
The analysis of Google Trends data reveals a notable shift in public concern from 
traditional digital platforms to the emergent realm of AI, particularly ChatGPT. 
This shift is evidenced by the increasing search queries related to the negative 
perceptions of ChatGPT, such as stress and anxiety, which not only surpass those 
related to social media anxiety but also mark a growing apprehension about the 
psychological impacts of advanced AI technologies. This emerging trend underscores 
the necessity for further research and dialogue on how AI influences mental health, 
privacy, and societal norms, pointing towards an evolving landscape of societal focus 
and concern in the digital age.

## ChatGPT simulation
Based on a psychology dataset we run a trial of asking ChatGPR requests from people 
seeking mental support. And we compared the answers of ChatGPT to a human mental 
counselor's answers. ChatGPT shows a moderate level of similarity (average 73%). We 
could differentiate requests by topics and the results among them differ. There are 
topics where ChatGPT performs well (up to 85%), like Job Loss, PTSD, Control Issues. 
And there are topics where it gives a low score (down to 42%), like Manipulation, 
Bullying, Bipolar Disorder. These results can not be taken with 100% confidence, but 
they show that it is important to use ChatGPT for mental health support cautiously, as 
complete reliance on it may not always provide good results, and in many cases human 
support should be a preferred option.
