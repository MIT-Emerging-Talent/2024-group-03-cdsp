1,"After my fiancé cheated on me because of a miscommunication, I pulled myself away from him.    Now he says all he wants is be with me. I'm pushing him away mentally now because he cheated on me again. I make plans with him that I don't keep. I really do love him still and I care about him. Should I give home one more chance?","Relationship Issues, Trust Issues",1,"I'm sorry to hear that you're going through this difficult situation. It's understandable that you're feeling hurt and conflicted. Trust is a crucial foundation of any relationship, and it's natural to feel hesitant about giving someone another chance after they have broken that trust.

Before making a decision, it's important to take some time to reflect on your feelings and consider what is best for your well-being. Ask yourself if you can truly forgive your fiancé and rebuild trust with him. Communication is key in any relationship, so consider having an open and honest conversation with him about your concerns and how his actions have affected you.

Ultimately, the decision to give him another chance is yours to make. Trust your instincts and prioritize your own emotional health and happiness. Remember that you deserve to be with someone who respects and values you. If you do decide to give him another chance, it might be helpful to seek couples counseling to work through the issues together.",[63],63,63,63.0
2,"Any time things get heated, the past gets brought up. I raise my voice at her to try to get a point across. She asks open-ended questions but always has to turn my own answer against me. She's seven months pregnant. I have drank in the past, but I'm not dependent on alcohol—I only drink at social events.","Relationship Issues, Alcohol Abuse",1,"It sounds like there may be some communication issues in your relationship that are causing tension. When discussing sensitive topics, it's important to try to remain calm and respectful, even when things get heated. Raising your voice can escalate the situation and make it harder to have a productive conversation.

Since your partner is seven months pregnant, it's important to be extra mindful of her emotions and well-being during this time. Pregnancy can be a challenging and emotional period, so it's important to approach discussions with empathy and understanding.

When past issues are brought up, try to focus on addressing the present situation rather than getting caught up in past arguments. It may also be helpful to set boundaries around certain topics that tend to lead to arguments.

As for the alcohol consumption, it's great that you are aware of your drinking habits and that you only drink at social events. However, if alcohol has been a source of conflict in your relationship in the past, it may be worth discussing how both of you feel about it and finding a compromise that works for both of you.

Overall, open and honest communication, active listening, and empathy are key in navigating difficult conversations and maintaining a healthy relationship. If you find that you are struggling to communicate effectively, couples therapy can also be a helpful resource to work through issues together.",[70],70,70,70.0
