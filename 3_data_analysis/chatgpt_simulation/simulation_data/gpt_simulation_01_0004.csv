Erectile dysfunction (ED) can have various causes, including physical, psychological, or a combination of both. It's important to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause and receive appropriate treatment.

Here are some common factors that could contribute to ED:

1. Psychological factors: Stress, anxiety, depression, performance pressure, and relationship issues can all impact sexual performance.

2. Physical health: Conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, or hormonal imbalances can affect erectile function.

3. Lifestyle factors: Smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, lack of exercise, poor diet, and certain medications can also contribute to ED.

To address your concerns, consider taking the following steps:

1. Seek professional help: Schedule an appointment with a healthcare provider, such as a urologist or a sex therapist, to discuss your symptoms and undergo a thorough evaluation.

2. Open communication: Talk openly with your wife about your struggles. Sharing your feelings and concerns can help alleviate some of the pressure you may be feeling.

3. Healthy lifestyle changes: Incorporate regular exercise, a balanced diet, stress-reducing activities, and quality sleep into your routine. Avoid smoking and limit alcohol consumption.

4. Explore therapy: Individual or couples therapy can help address underlying emotional issues and improve communication within your relationship.

5. Consider medication: Your healthcare provider may recommend medications such as Viagra, Cialis, or Levitra to help with erectile function. These should only be taken under medical supervision.

Remember, you are not alone in facing this challenge, and seeking help is a positive step towards finding a solution. Take care of yourself and prioritize your mental and physical well-being.",[75 82 85 70 85 85],70,85,80.33333333333333
1,"After 40 years of being straight, how could I now find myself interested in people of the same sex? I have had a few same sex encounters of my own doing.","Sexuality, Confusion",6,"Sexual orientation can be fluid and may change over time for some individuals. It's not uncommon for someone who has identified as straight for many years to suddenly find themselves attracted to people of the same sex. 

Exploring and understanding your own sexuality is a personal journey, and it's important to approach it with self-compassion and an open mind. It's also important to remember that there is no right or wrong way to experience attraction.

If you are feeling confused or conflicted about your feelings, it may be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor who specializes in LGBTQ+ issues. They can provide support, guidance, and a safe space for you to explore and understand your feelings.

Remember, it's okay to be true to yourself and to embrace your authentic feelings and desires. What matters most is that you are true to yourself and your own happiness.",[85 70 85 90 70 60],60,90,76.66666666666667
