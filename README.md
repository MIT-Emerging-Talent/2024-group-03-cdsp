## Investigation of connections between depression development and excessive social media and AI chatbot usage

## Overview
Mental health care is crucial for overall well-being, as it encompasses emotional, 
psychological, and social aspects of a person's life. One significant aspect of mental health in the digital age is the rise of internet 
addiction. With the increasing prevalence of smartphones, social media platforms, and 
development of AI tools, individuals are becoming more susceptible to excessive internet
usage, leading to addiction. Our team decided to investigate how reliance on AI for emotional support or guidance may
affect individuals' perceptions of their own mental well-being. Identifying potential
risks allows for the development of safeguards and guidelines to minimize harm.

AI is the latest trend, we notice some people prefer chatting with AI instead of having
conversation with friends, family members, or real people.
The increasing preference for chatting with AI rather than real people presents a unique
psychological landscape with potential implications for mental health. While conversing
with AI can offer convenience, anonymity, and immediate responses, it also poses risks
for certain individuals.

## Methodology

Please follow the link to read full description for 
our approach to the[system thinking and design thinking](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/2024-group-11-cdsp/blob/main/milestone/milestone_1/system_design_thinking.md)

1. Empathize: From personal and close people experience we understand that Internet, social media
and AI tools and give us not only benefits, but also some risks and theis understanding helps
us to decrease the harmful impact. 
2. Define the issue: We will explore the connections between growing of popularity of
social media (10-5 years ago), AI chatbots (last two years) and level of depression in different
countries.
3. Ideas how to explore: While we don't have open data connected with AI usage, we want to analise
global trends for the level of depression since 2000 when Internet tarted to gain the popularity
and no social media existed, then how it changed in 2010-2015 with growing of popularity of Social
media, and then the most fresh data. We will explore the connections between development of social
media and AI and diagnosed depression. 
4. Iterate: We are going to continuously refine our solution based on the feedback, insights, and
new discoveries.
